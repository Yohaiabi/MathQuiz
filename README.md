# MathQuiz
 This Python project generates a dynamic math quiz where users can select the language (English or Hebrew) and difficulty level. The quiz presents random math problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and provides real-time feedback on whether the user's answers are correct or not. The score is displayed at the end of the quiz.
